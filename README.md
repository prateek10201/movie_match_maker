## Overview
Movie MatchMaker is an AI-powered movie recommendation system that delivers personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences, mood, and viewing history. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze movie features and provide tailored recommendations.

## Features
- **Content-based Recommendations**: Suggests movies similar to ones you already like
- **Mood-based Recommendations**: Matches movies to your current emotional state
- **Discovery Mode**: Find hidden gems, underrated movies, and cult classics
- **Regional Cinema**: Explore movies from different film industries (Hollywood, Bollywood, etc.)
- **Multiple Filtering Options**: Filter by genre, rating, time period, and popularity
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Science**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity
- **Deployment**: Render

## Deployment Process
The application is deployed on Render with the following configuration:
1. Connected GitHub repository to Render
2. Configured as a Web Service with Python runtime
3. Set the build command to `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set the start command to `gunicorn app:app`
5. Ensured proper file path handling for deployment environment

## Development Journey
This project was developed as part of a final project for an AI course. The development process involved:

1. **Understanding User Needs**: Conducted surveys to understand movie preferences and frustrations with existing recommendation systems
2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Used a comprehensive movie dataset and applied cleaning and feature extraction
3. **Model Development**: Implemented TF-IDF and cosine similarity for content-based filtering
4. **UI Design & Integration**: Created an intuitive interface for capturing preferences and displaying recommendations
5. **Testing & Refinement**: Tested with users and refined based on feedback
6. **Deployment**: Deployed to Render for public access
